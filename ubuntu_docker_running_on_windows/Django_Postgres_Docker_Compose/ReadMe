Remember, when you do python manage.py makemigrations (or migrate), you have to do it inside app container, so do thid first:
docker exec -it af5a7643dcab /bin/bash
to get inside of the container, and then do your migrations

How to transfer to Windows: Make a copy of the directory, and db file will not be copied because of the permissions. It's ok, that's what we want. Zip up the copied directory and copy to google drive.
On widows, download the directory, start Docker Desktop and run "docker compose up --build". Create migrations in Docker Desktop.

sudo docker rm -f $(sudo docker ps -q)
To stop container starting automatically when docker starts use:
docker update --restart=no container_name

docker container run -it [yourImage] bash

docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker-compose up --force-recreate

Today I had the same issue that all containers are started when I boot my dev laptop, as restart: always was set in the .yml files.

As I don't want to touch the .yml files, I just found out (thx Bobby) how to alter this setting by:

docker update --restart=no <MY-CONTAINER-ID>


Try with docker-compose down instead of docker-compose stop

down

Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by up. Networks and volumes defined as external are never removed.

stop

Stops running containers
