You can build the Docker image with the following command:

docker build -t my-python-app .
Bash
This command builds the Docker image and tags (-t) it as my-python-app. The . specifies that Docker should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

By default, Docker uses the Overlay2 driver, which stores images in a directory called /var/lib/docker/overlay2 .

Export the Image on Ubuntu:

bash
Copy code
docker save -o your_image.tar your_image_name:tag

Import the Image on Windows:

bash
Copy code on Windows
docker load -i your_image.tar

The image will show up in docker desktop and you can run it
